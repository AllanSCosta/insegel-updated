Overview

Insegel is a theme for Sphinx, intended to be used for my personal projects'
documentation. Though it can be deployed anywhere, the theme is specifically 
made to be deployed on `ReadTheDocs`_. This theme is meant to match the 
aesthetic of my portfolio `Hrǽw`_, and so is not particularily customisable.

It is still a work in progress and thus lacks features such as tablet/mobile 
specific styling, version navigation, toc tree styling, etc.
