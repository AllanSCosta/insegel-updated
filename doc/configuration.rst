Configuration
=============

The theme does not have any configurable settings, as it is intended to strictly
conform to a set design. However, this will change in future.

For now, the only thing that is configurable is the way that the build date
is displayed. This can be changed by modifying ``html_last_updated_fmt`` in
your documentations `conf.py`.
